       " for this thoughtful column. There is a growing movement of young people calling for climate action and environmental justice, through school strikes, sit-ins and a recent lawsuit in Quebec against the federal government’s failure to take meaningful action. Parents and teachers want the best for our children. But we are busy and anxious providing what they need to thrive now, so it’s hard to look to the future at something over which we seem to have so little control. As a new parent, there is nothing I want more than for my daughter to grow up in a stable climate, not only for herself. And I don’t want her to have the weight of knowing that children in other places are facing hunger, flooding or displacement because we didn’t act. If we come together in solidarity with the youth, we have power. In Canada, we can lead the way to the rapid and intense climate action the planet needs. No new fossil-fuel infrastructure. We need high and rising carbon taxes returned to the taxpayers and intense investment in green infrastructure, jobs and social justice infrastructure. \n",

       " also claimed of the Cloverdale Sport and Ice Complex, “The land underneath is very unstable. Our engineering department says we would not be able to build this on unstable ground unless we used pile driving techniques to build it. Pile driving if anyone knows construction is very expensive construction. Originally it was planned to be $45 million, but that would increase considerably if we had to pile drive it.”. </br> In fact, the original cost of the Cloverdale complex was $35 million, city documents say. In January 2018, reports indicated there were problems with the soil and the estimated cost was hiked to $44.5 million. </br> Attempts by CTV News to confirm with the city’s engineering department that there were even more problems with the soil on top of the previously discovered issues, which could increase costs even further, were stymied as city staff said they could not talk during the budget process. </br> In the city’s preliminary budget in December, the cost of the arena is still listed at $44.5 million. </br> The above chart from the City of Surrey suggests a dip in registration for youth ice sports. </br> . </br> Exaggerating a drop in youth ice sports. </br> The mayor also claimed that the enrolment of young people in ice sports was dropping – another justification for cutting the construction of the Cloverdale complex. </br> “We have in the last eight to nine years had a declining use of ice for hockey. Each year it’s declining in participation and usage. We have a chart of that to show you,” the mayor told reporters. </br> CTV News has analyzed the chart, which seemed to show a decline in enrolment of around 50 per cent. But the axes of the chart exaggerated this drop. When the axes were changed, the decline the numbers represented appeared closer to 15 per cent. </br> There was another problem. </br> For every year before 2018-19, the chart reflected the number of children playing ice sports for the whole year. But for the 2018-19 year, staff used the figures for October. The result, according to a survey of listed clubs by CTV News, is 352 missing children. </br> When those members are included in the chart, it’s clear that there are more children enrolled in 2018-19 than the past two years – and the alleged drop is actually an increase. </br> On top of that, the chart did not include bantam or midget teams – another 100 children – anyone in the city’s ice lessons, which includes 17,040 registrations, or anyone on the waitlist, whose estimates run from the city claim of 974 to the city’s Ice Allocation Committee estimate of 1,400. </br> “I know that our arenas are used more than what’s listed in that graph,” said \n",

       ", who sits on the Ice Allocation Committee. “That graph should go in the other direction.”. </br> Secord told CTV News that two minor ice hockey leagues have spent $450,000 buying 1,000 hours of ice time in neighbouring communities like Richmond or Delta. </br> “We could not supply one sheet of ice for them for any games all year,” she said. “We’re turning away potential users because there’s nothing there.”. </br> Surrey staff explained the numbers this way: “There are many possible reasons why the 2018 numbers appear low which may include waitlist accommodation, adding teaching stations, waitlist management. The numbers are being run from our stored data is not being modified.”. </br> Several of the clubs are now writing Surrey City Council as it proceeds to its final approval of its budget on Monday night, asking the city to correct its figures. </br> Viewing this article on our beta mobile site?
